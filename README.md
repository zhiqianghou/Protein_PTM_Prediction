# Protein_PTM_Prediction
This code predicts potential post-translational modifications (PTMs) on lysine residues in the input protein, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation. The code uses the NetPhos algorithm to predict phosphorylation sites and retrieves known PTM sites from UniProt. The output is a list of potential lysine PTM sites and a plot of the tau protein sequence highlighting these sites.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* requests module
* matplotlib module
* NetPhos (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/webface2.fcgi)
* UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/)
